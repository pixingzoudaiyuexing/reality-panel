//! v1.2.5: command-line recovery, run against the same database the server uses.
//!
//! Exists because the only way to recover a lost admin password was to edit the
//! database by hand — pasting a bcrypt placeholder string full of `$` through a
//! shell, which mangles under quoting, only worked for user id 1, and failed
//! SILENTLY when the pattern did not match. An operator locked out of their own
//! panel is exactly the person who should not be debugging shell escaping.
//!
//! These subcommands are reachable only from the CLI. Anyone who can run them
//! already has the database file, so they add no attack surface — but they must
//! never be wired to an HTTP route.

    relay-panel --version                       print the compiled version

reset-admin-password:
    USER defaults to `admin`. A strong password is generated and printed once —
    it is not read from the arguments, because anything passed on the command
    line lands in shell history and is visible to `ps` on a shared host.

    All of that account's existing sessions are signed out.
