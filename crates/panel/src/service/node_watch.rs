//! v1.2.0: node offline/recovery detection and alerting.
//!
//! Scans the `node_status:*` kvs rows on a timer and notifies when a node has
//! been silent for longer than the configured threshold, then again when it
//! comes back.
//!
//! ## Why this isn't just "online == false"
//!
//! The UI paints a node offline after `NODE_ONLINE_WINDOW_SECS` (30s), which is
//! the right call for a status dot — it should react fast. It is the wrong
//! trigger for an alert: a node that misses two status reports on a flaky link
//! is briefly "offline" and perfectly healthy, and paging on that trains the
//! operator to ignore the channel. Alerting therefore has its OWN, longer
//! threshold (default 180s ≈ six missed reports).
//!
//! ## Why state is in memory
//!
//! Same reasoning as the auto-restart scheduler: persisting "was offline" would
//! mean a panel restart replays alerts for everything that happened while it
//! was down, so an upgrade would open with a burst of stale pages. Keeping it
//! in memory re-baselines on boot — nodes are observed fresh, and only
//! transitions seen by THIS process are announced.
//!
//! The cost is that a node which goes down exactly during a panel restart is
//! first observed as already-offline. That case is handled explicitly below
//! (see `first_seen_offline`) rather than being silently dropped.
