// v0.4.3 PR2: PostgreSQL implementation of the Repository traits.
//
// Mirror of `sqlite_repo` — same trait contracts, same method shapes, but
// PostgreSQL-native SQL. The SQL is a mechanical translation of the SQLite
// version, NOT a redesign:
//   - `?` placeholders → `$1, $2, ...` numbered placeholders (PG requirement).
//   - `INSERT OR REPLACE INTO kvs` → `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (key) DO UPDATE
//     SET value = EXCLUDED.value` (PG upsert).
//   - boolean columns are BOOLEAN on PG (vs INTEGER 0/1 on SQLite). sqlx's
//     FromRow handles both transparently for the `bool` fields on our models.
//   - `LIKE 'prefix%'` stays — PG supports LIKE with the same wildcard.
//
// No migrations here (unlike SQLite). PG support is new in v0.4.3, so there
// are no "old PG databases" to upgrade; init_pg creates the full schema from
// pg_schema.rs on first boot. The contract: user installs PG, creates an empty
// database, fills in the connection string; the panel does the rest.
//
// Transaction isolation: PG defaults to READ COMMITTED (vs SQLite's
// effectively-SERIALIZABLE single-writer). apply_traffic_batch's ownership
// check + write run on the same tx handle, so a concurrent writer can't slip
// between the SELECT and UPDATE — but a concurrent transaction COULD update
// the same row after our SELECT and before our UPDATE, making our increment
// race. This matches the SQLite contract (which also isn't row-locked); the
// traffic counter is monotonic-additive so the worst case is a momentarily
// stale read, never a lost write (the UPDATE itself is atomic).
